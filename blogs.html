                    September 9th marked a turning point for me. Without informing my parents, I resigned from an exhausting
                    8-hour standing job, deciding to focus fully on my journey as a computer science student. In my first
                    semester, I spent most of my time wondering where to begin with coding, feeling somewhat lost. Then, in
                    my second semester, my computer broke down, pushing me to take up that job as my studies came to a
                    halt—since I'm an online university student, no computer means no learning. Adding to this challenge was
                    the fact that I didn’t have a phone either.
                </p>

                <p>
                    But this September, I decided to start my learning journey with clarity and purpose. I wanted to
                    document each step and every struggle to remind myself of the progress I’ve made each month. This blog
                    is where I’ll share that journey, capturing the highs and lows, with a hope to inspire others and to
                    keep myself motivated as I move forward.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As I began planning my career, I realized that web development would be an ideal starting point. It
                    combines programming, creativity, design, backend work, and database management—all skills that are
                    highly valuable. Plus, web development offers a fast track to job opportunities, allowing me to gain
                    practical experience even before completing my degree.
                </p>

                <h2 id="html-css">Starting with HTML and CSS</h2>
                <p>
                    Alongside web development, my love for Korean dramas inspired me to learn a new language for fun. So, I
                    enrolled in a full-stack web development course on Udemy and a Korean language course on Coursera.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Starting with HTML and CSS, I followed tutorials, created projects, and practiced positioning
                    techniques. One project included a bit of animation, but since the course didn’t cover it, I learned
                    animations separately and added them myself, giving my work a unique touch. You can see this project
                    here.
                </p>

                <h2 id="flexbox">Tackling Flexbox</h2>
                <p>
                    Next, I tackled Flexbox, which took longer than I anticipated. I spent almost three days on a small
                    project because I struggled with the concept initially. However, after much practice, Flexbox became one
                    of my strengths. Now, I can create complex layouts and understand intricate design logic with ease. I
                    decided to skip Grid for now, but I'm looking forward to diving into JavaScript next.
                </p>

                <h2 id="javascript">Diving into JavaScript</h2>
                <p>
                    After building a strong foundation in HTML and CSS, I decided to dive into JavaScript. I completed a
                    JavaScript course with Angela Yu, where I worked on several projects, including a dice game and a drum
                    kit. The drum kit project taught me about event listeners and how to implement them, which felt like a
                    big step forward.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once I finished Angela's course, I realized I wanted to push my skills further by working on my own.
                    Inspired by a college example, I created a Rock, Paper, Scissors game. This project tested my knowledge
                    and allowed me to experiment, which boosted my confidence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Around this time, I also discovered the importance of LinkedIn. Since many students and developers use
                    LinkedIn to network and share their work, I joined the platform to connect with others in my field and
                    showcase my projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next, I followed Sher Yarns' tutorials to create a Pinterest-style search bar. This project was exciting
                    because I learned how to filter an array and dynamically add HTML content using JavaScript objects.
                    Afterward, I explored Bootstrap through Angela's course and built a website called MoveIt. While I still
                    need more practice with Bootstrap, this was a solid starting point for responsive design.
                </p>

                <h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>
                <p>
                    My journey continues as I refine my skills, and I'm excited to see where it leads.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I’ve set ambitious goals for October. I plan to
                    build a personal portfolio website using Bootstrap, where I can showcase all my projects and progress.
                    Additionally, I’m excited to take on a challenging project: creating an Amazon clone. My goal is to make
                    it as functional as possible with JavaScript features, covering new topics like local storage,
                    horizontal scrolling, and API fetching. I’ll also ensure that the clone is fully responsive and add as
                    many interactive features as I can.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To take things further, I hope to complete my learning of the JavaScript framework, React, which will
                    allow me to build more advanced and dynamic web applications. It’s been incredibly rewarding to progress
                    from the basics to a level where I feel confident in my HTML and CSS skills. Web development is opening
                    up new opportunities for me, and I’m eager to keep learning and growing in this field.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I plan to document my progress regularly in this blog, not just to track my own development but to share
                    insights and lessons learned with others who may be on a similar journey. I hope to inspire fellow
                    beginners to embrace their struggles and celebrate their victories, no matter how small they may seem.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Thank you for joining me on this journey! I look forward to sharing more of my experiences in the
                    coming months.
